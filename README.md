## embedTwitchCSS

Embedding a twitch stream on an external site with the twitch provided code leaves a lot to be desired. This is a simple style sheet that let's you easily drop in a responsive twitch stream & chat while maintaining a proper 16:9 video ratio. In the example I've put the stream and chat next to each other and set the width to be 75% and 25% respectfully. You should adjust those percentages to your liking, the stream will maintain 16:9 regardless of it's width. I also included a default media query that hides the chat if the screen gets too small. You should adjust that trigger to your needs as well.

an example is up and running here: http://jcrastelli.com/projects/embedTwitchCSS/

## Code Example

To use as is, download **embedTwitchCSS.css** and link the style sheet to your page 

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="**YOUR-FILE-STRUCTURE**/embedTwitchCSS.css" />
```

then put two divs **twitchStream** and **twitchChat** inside the **twitchWrapper** on your page.

```html
...

<div class='twitchWrapper'>
  <div class='twitchStream'>
    <iframe src="https://player.twitch.tv/?channel=**YOUR-CHANNEL-NAME**" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>
  </div>
  <div class='twitchChat'>
    <iframe frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.twitch.tv/embed/**YOUR-CHANNEL-NAME**/chat"></iframe>
  </div>
</div>

...
```

and you should be ready to rock!

I'd suggest you edit the width ratio between twitchStream and twitchChat and the media query trigger as per your needs. And if you're using another library to handle widths just drop the width property from those two elements entirely.

## Installation

Either download the whole project to get the implementation example index.html file or simple just download the embedTwitchCSS.css file within the css folder

If anyone notices anything wonky or has any suggestions I'm all ears

Big thanks to http://www.mademyday.de/css-height-equals-width-with-pure-css.html for the help with the 16:9 calculations and set up. This borrows heavily from them
